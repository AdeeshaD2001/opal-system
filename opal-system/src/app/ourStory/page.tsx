            At CeylonX Hotels, our journey began with a vision to redefine luxury and hospitality in Sri Lanka. Established over two decades ago, we embarked on a mission to create a chain of hotels that offer unparalleled comfort and a genuine sense of Sri Lankan warmth. Our founder, inspired by the island's rich heritage and stunning landscapes, envisioned a brand that combines elegance with local charm.

            From our first boutique hotel nestled in the hills of Kandy, we have expanded our reach across the island, offering guests a unique experience at each location. Our hotels are thoughtfully designed to reflect the diverse beauty of Sri Lanka, from serene coastal retreats to vibrant city escapes. Each property is a testament to our commitment to providing exceptional service and creating memorable experiences for our guests.
